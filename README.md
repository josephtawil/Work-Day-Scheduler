# Work Day Schedule

* This is a Schedule Table where users can insert upcoming events into their calender.

* In this project, I used a variety of tools to complete this project. To create the visual aspects of the table, I used Bootstrap's grid tools. For the styling, I had used CSS to differentiate the buttons on the screen.

* For the functionality of the application, I used local storage to store the user's input into the user's local storage. Whenever the user refreshes the page, the data will still be present.

* I am still working on the deletion of events from the local storage and the table.
